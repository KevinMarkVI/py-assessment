# A test-driven approach to assessing Python skills

This respository was inspired on `Rebecca Murphey` [js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment) project, and attempts to help our awesome students at [rmotr.com](http://rmotr.com).

### Set up
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
    $ py.test

If you end up with all passing tests you can consider yourself as a Python Ninja. If not, keep working hard until you achieve it.
